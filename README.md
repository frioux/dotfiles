# Vicious

Vicious is a modular widget library for window managers, but mostly
catering to users of the *awesome* window manager. It was derived from
the old *Wicked* widget library, and has some of the old *Wicked* widget
types, a few of them rewritten, and a good number of new ones:

* https://github.com/vicious-widgets/vicious

Vicious widget types are a framework for creating your own
widgets. Vicious contains modules that gather data about your system,
and a few *awesome* helper functions that make it easier to register
timers, suspend widgets and so on. Vicious doesn't depend on any third party
Lua libraries, but may depend on additional system utilities (see widget
description).

## Usage

When provided by an operating system package, or installed from source
into the Lua library path Vicious can be used as a regular Lua
library, to be used stand-alone or to feed widgets of any window
manager (e.g. Ion, WMII). It is compatible with both Lua v5.1 and v5.2.

```lua
> widgets = require("vicious.widgets.init")
> print(widgets.volume(nil, "Master")[1])
100
```

## Usage within Awesome

To use Vicious with Awesome, install the package from your operating
system provider, or download the source code and move it to your
awesome configuration directory in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `~/.config`):

```bash
$ mv vicious $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/
```

Vicious will only load modules for widget types you intend to use in
your awesome configuration, to avoid having useless modules sitting in
your memory.

Then add the following to the top of your `rc.lua`:

```lua
local vicious = require("vicious")
```

Once you create a widget (a textbox, graph or a progressbar) call
`vicious.register()` to register it with Vicious:

    vicious.register(widget, wtype, format, interval, warg)

### widget

*Awesome* widget created with `widget()` or `awful.widget()` (in case of a
graph or a progressbar).

### wtype

Type: Vicious widget or `function`:

* Vicious widget type: any of the available (default, or custom)
  [widget type provided by Vicious](#widgets).
* function: custom function from your own *Awesome* configuration can be
  registered as widget types (see [Custom widget types](#custom-widget)).

### format

Type: `string` or `function`:

* string: `$key` will be replaced by respective value in the table `t` returned
  by the widget type. I.e. use `$1`, `$2`, etc. to retrieve data from an
  integer-indexed table (a.k.a. array); `${foo bar}` will be substituted by
  `t["{foo bar}"]`.
* `function (widget, args)` can be used to manipulate data returned by the
  widget type (see [Format functions](#format-func)).

### interval

Number of seconds between updates of the widget (default: 2). Read section
[Power and Caching](#power) for more information.

### warg

Some widget types require an argument to be passed, for example the battery ID.

## Other functions

`vicious.register` alone is not much different from
[awful.widget.watch](https://awesomewm.org/doc/api/classes/awful.widget.watch.html),
which has been added to Awesome since version 4.0. However, Vicious offers more
advanced control of widgets' behavior by providing the following functions.

### Unregister a widget

    vicious.unregister(widget, keep)

If `keep == true`, `widget` will be suspended and wait for activation.

### Suspend all widgets

    vicious.suspend()

See [example automation script](http://sysphere.org/~anrxc/local/sources/lmt-vicious.sh)
for the "laptop-mode-tools" start-stop module.

### Restart suspended widgets

    vicious.activate(widget)

If `widget` is provided only that widget will be activated.

### Enable caching of a widget type

    vicious.cache(wtype)

Enable caching of values returned by a widget type.

### Force update of widgets

    vicious.force(wtable)

`wtable` is a table of one or more widgets to be updated.

### Get data from a widget

    vicious.call(wtype, format, warg)

Fetch data from `wtype` to use it outside from the wibox
([example](#call-example)).

## <a name="widgets"></a>Widget types

Widget types consist of worker functions that take two arguments `format` and
`warg` (in that order), which were previously passed to `vicious.register`, and
return a table of values to be formatted by `format`.

## <a name="custom-widget"></a>Custom widget types

Use any of the existing widget types as a starting point for your
own. Write a quick worker function that does the work and plug it
in. How data will be formatted, will it be red or blue, should be
defined in rc.lua (or somewhere else, outside the actual module).

Before writing a widget type you should check if there is already one in the
contrib directory of Vicious. The contrib directory contains extra widgets you
can use. Some are for less common hardware, and other were contributed by
Vicious users. Most of the contrib widgets are obsolete. Contrib widgets will
not be imported by init unless you explicitly enable it, or load them in your
rc.lua.

Some users would like to avoid writing new modules. For them Vicious
kept the old Wicked functionality, possibility to register their own
functions as widget types. By providing them as the second argument to
vicious.register. Your function can accept `format` and `warg`
arguments, just like workers.


## <a name="power"></a>Power and Caching

When a lot of widgets are in use they, and awesome, can generate a lot
of wake-ups and also be very expensive for system resources. This is
especially important when running on battery power. It was a big
problem with awesome v2 and widgets that used shell scripts to gather
data, and with widget libraries written in languages like Ruby.

Lua is an extremely fast and efficient programming language, and
Vicious takes advantage of that. But suspending Vicious widgets is one
way to prevent them from draining your battery, despite that.

Update intervals also play a big role, and you can save a lot of power
with a smart approach. Don't use intervals like: 5, 10, 30, 60, â¦ to
avoid harmonics. If you take the 60-second mark as an example, all of
your widgets would be executed at that point. Instead think about
using only prime numbers, in that case you will have only a few
widgets executed at any given time interval. When choosing intervals
also consider what a widget actually does. Some widget types read
files that reside in memory, others call external utilities and some,
like the mbox widget, read big files.

Vicious can also cache values returned by widget types. Caching
enables you to have multiple widgets using the same widget type. With
caching its worker function gets executed only once - which is also
great for saving power.

* Some widget types keep internal data and if you call one multiple times
  without caching, the widget that executes it first would modify stored
  values. This can lead to problems and give you inconsistent data. Remember
  it for widget types like CPU and Network usage, which compare the old set of
  data with the new one to calculate current usage.

* Widget types that require a widget argument to be passed should be handled
  carefully. If you are requesting information for different devices then
  caching should not be used, because you could get inconsistent data.


## Security

At the moment only one widget type (Gmail) requires auth. information
in order to get to the data. In the future there could be more, and
you should give some thought to the issue of protecting your data. The
Gmail widget type by default stores login information in the ~/.netrc
file, and you are advised to make sure that file is only readable by
the owner. Other than that we can not force all users to conform to
one standard, one way of keeping it secure, like in some keyring.

First let's clear why we simply don't encrypt the login information
and store it in ciphertext. By exposing the algorithm anyone can
reverse the encryption steps. Some claim even that's better than
plaintext but it's just security trough obscurity.

Here are some ideas actually worth your time. Users that have KDE (or
parts of it) installed could store their login information into the
Kwallet service and request it via DBus from the widget type. It can
be done with tools like `dbus-send` and `qdbus`. The Gnome keyring
should support the same, so those with parts of Gnome installed could
use that keyring.

Users of GnuPG (and its agent) could consider encrypting the netrc
file with their GPG key. Trough the GPG Passphrase Agent they could
then decrypt the file transparently while their session is active.

## Usage examples

Start with a simple widget, like `date`. Then build your setup from
there, one widget at a time. Also remember that besides creating and
registering widgets you have to add them to a `wibox` (statusbar) in
order to actually display them.

### Date widget

Update every 2 seconds (the default interval), use standard date sequences as
the format string:

```lua
datewidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(datewidget, vicious.widgets.date, "%b %d, %R")
```

### Memory widget

Update every 13 seconds, append `MiB` to 2nd and 3rd returned values and
enables caching.

```lua
memwidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.cache(vicious.widgets.mem)
vicious.register(memwidget, vicious.widgets.mem, "$1 ($2MiB/$3MiB)", 13)
```

### HDD temperature widget

Update every 19 seconds, request the temperature level of the /dev/sda and
append *Â°C* to the returned value. Since the listening port is not provided,
default one is used.

```lua
hddtempwidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(hddtempwidget, vicious.widgets.hddtemp, "${/dev/sda} Â°C", 19)
```

### Mbox widget

Updated every 5 seconds, provide full path to the mbox as argument:

```lua
mboxwidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(mboxwidget, vicious.widgets.mbox, "$1", 5,
                 "/home/user/mail/Inbox")
```

### Battery widget

Update every 61 seconds, request the current battery charge level and displays
a progressbar, provides `"BAT0"` as battery ID:

```lua
batwidget = wibox.widget.progressbar()

-- Create wibox with batwidget
batbox = wibox.layout.margin(
    wibox.widget{{max_value = 1, widget = batwidget,
                  border_width = 0.5, border_color = "#000000",
                  color = {type = "linear",
                           from = {0, 0},
                           to = {0, 30},
                           stops = {{0, "#AECF96"}, {1, "#FF5656"}}}},
                 forced_height = 10, forced_width = 8,
                 direction = 'east', color = beautiful.fg_widget,
                 layout = wibox.container.rotate},
    1, 1, 3, 3)

-- Register battery widget
vicious.register(batwidget, vicious.widgets.bat, "$2", 61, "BAT0")
```

### CPU usage widget

Update every 3 seconds, feed the graph with total usage percentage of all
CPUs/cores:

```lua
cpuwidget = awful.widget.graph()
cpuwidget:set_width(50)
cpuwidget:set_background_color"#494B4F"
cpuwidget:set_color{type = "linear", from = {0, 0}, to = {50, 0},
                    stops = {{0, "#FF5656"}, {0.5, "#88A175"}, {1, "#AECF96"}}}
vicious.register(cpuwidget, vicious.widgets.cpu, "$1", 3)
```

## <a name="format-func"></a>Format functions

You can use a function instead of a string as the format parameter.
Then you are able to check the value returned by the widget type and
change it or perform some action. You can change the color of the
battery widget when it goes below a certain point, hide widgets when
they return a certain value or maybe use `string.format` for padding.

Do not confuse this with just coloring the widget, in those cases standard
Pango markup can be inserted into the format string.

The format function will get the widget as its first argument, table
with the values otherwise inserted into the format string as its
second argument, and will return the text/data to be used for the
widget.

### Examples

#### Hide mpd widget when no song is playing

```lua
mpdwidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(
    mpdwidget,
    vicious.widgets.mpd,
    function (widget, args)
        if args["{state}"] == "Stop" then
            return ''
        else
            return ('<span color="white">MPD:</span> %s - %s'):format(
                args["{Artist}"], args["{Title}"])
        end
    end)
```

#### Use string.format for padding

```lua
uptimewidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(uptimewidget, vicious.widgets.uptime,
                 function (widget, args)
                     return ("Uptime: %02d %02d:%02d "):format(
                         args[1], args[2], args[3])
                 end, 61)
```

When it comes to padding it is also useful to mention how a widget can be
configured to have a fixed width. You can set a fixed width on your textbox
widgets by changing their `width` field (by default width is automatically
adapted to text width). The following code forces a fixed width of 50 px to the
uptime widget, and aligns its text to the right:

```lua
uptimewidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
uptimewidget.width, uptimewidget.align = 50, "right"
vicious.register(uptimewidget, vicious.widgets.uptime, "$1 $2:$3", 61)
```

#### Stacked graph

Stacked graphs are handled specially by Vicious: `format` functions passed to
the corresponding widget types must return an array instead of a string.

```lua
cpugraph = wibox.widget.graph()
cpugraph:set_stack(true)
cpugraph:set_stack_colors({"red", "yellow", "green", "blue"})
vicious.register(cpugraph, vicious.widgets.cpu,
                 function (widget, args)
                     return {args[2], args[3], args[4], args[5]}
                 end, 3)
```

The snipet above enables graph stacking/multigraph and plots usage of all four
CPU cores on a single graph.

#### Substitute widget types' symbols

If you are not happy with default symbols used in volume, battery, cpufreq and
other widget types, use your own symbols without any need to modify modules.
The following example uses a custom table map to modify symbols representing
the mixer state: on or off/mute.

```lua
volumewidget = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(volumewidget, vicious.widgets.volume,
                 function (widget, args)
                     local label = {["â«"] = "O", ["â©"] = "M"}
                     return ("Volume: %d%% State: %s"):format(
                         args[1], label[args[2]])
                 end, 2, "PCM")
```

#### <a name="call-example"></a>Get data from the widget

`vicious.call` could be useful for naughty notification and scripts:

```lua
mybattery = wibox.widget.textbox()
vicious.register(mybattery, vicious.widgets.bat, "$2%", 17, "0")
mybattery:buttons(awful.util.table.join(
    awful.button(
        {}, 1,
        function ()
            naughty.notify{title = "Battery indicator",
                           text = vicious.call(vicious.widgets.bat,
                                               "Remaining time: $3", "0")}
        end)))
```

Format functions can be used as well:

```lua
mybattery:buttons(awful.util.table.join(
    awful.button(
        {}, 1,
        function ()
            naughty.notify{
                title = "Battery indicator",
                text = vicious.call(
                    vicious.widgets.bat,
                    function (widget, args)
                        return ("%s: %10sh\n%s: %14d%%\n%s: %12dW"):format(
                            "Remaining time", args[3],
                            "Wear level", args[4],
                            "Present rate", args[5])
                    end, "0")}
        end)))
```
