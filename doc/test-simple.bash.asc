NAME
----
test-simple - Simple TAP test framework for Bash

SYNOPSIS
--------

In a file, say, test/my_test.t:

    source test-simple.bash tests 5

    ok 0                    '0 is true (other numbers are false)'

    answer=$(question "...?")
    ok [ $answer == yes ]   'The answer is yes!'
    ok [[ $answer =~ ^y ]]  'The answer begins with y'

    ok true                 'true is ok'
    ok '! false'            '! false is true'

Run the tests:

    prove -ebash -v test/

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The `test-simple` library is meant to work for Bash, just like the
`Test::Simple` module does in Perl.

You can run the tests under any TAP harness tool. The `prove` utility is the
most popular one.

The library provides one function called `ok()`:

    ok <testing> <arguments> [<label>]

The last argument is assumed to be the a label, unless there is only one
argument, or unless its value is `]` or `]]`.

The test arguments are evaled and if the result is true, the test passes,
otherwise it fails.

INSTALLATION
------------

Just run:

    make install

Possibly with `sudo`. The default location to install is `/usr/local/lib/bash`
(assuming you are using `/bin/bash`). To override the installation location, do
something like this:

    INSTALL_DIR=/your/bash/lib/path make -e install
