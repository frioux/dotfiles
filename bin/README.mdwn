### `pomotimer`

Handy terminal based timer especially for [The Pomodoro

Allows pausing, resuming, and aborting the timer entirely.  If a

installed, will `pomotimer` will slowly decrease light from bright red to black,
ending with 5 green blinks.

Weird program I am not sure I ever used that simply runs a child process and
restarts it any time a new line comes in over STDIN.

### `screenshot-to-text`

runs OCR on the screenshot and places the results in the copy buffer.  For best
results make text of size 16 or higher.

10

Basically `tee -a` but only writes a single line and always adds a newline.

```
