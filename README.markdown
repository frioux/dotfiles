# regedit.vim

Regedit allows very simple modification of registers, for the purpose of
updating or correcting macros.  Check out the demo below:

![demo](https://github.com/frioux/vim-regedit/raw/master/demo.gif)

## Basic Usage

By default you'll have the mapping installed as `<leader>E`, so to edit the `w`
register, you'd press: `<leader>Ew`.  There is more detail in the included
documentation.

## Installation

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend installing
[pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and then simply copy and
paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/frioux/vim-regedit

Once help tags have been generated, you can view the manual with
`:help regedit`.
